Making the homework for the second time went fine. 
Shoppingcart was no problem at all. 
I used Superagent for the Async-assignment the first time, now I tried Fetch. I only got three arrays instead of one. 
The transform-assignment was a differnt story. I have taken const [, label] = and ([max]) from my previous notes from Arien. 
I really didn't know this anymore. I have spent a long time trying to rewrite the syntax in my own words but didn't manage to do so. But I don'd think I will forget this anymore :)
Although I hope that this isn't concidered as plagiarism. I think I would have felt better if I had received another assignment.
